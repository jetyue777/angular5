<h2>My Heroes</h2>

  <!--The *ngFor is Angular's repeater directive. It repeats the host element for each element in a list. Don't forget the asterisk (*) in front of ngFor. It's a critical part of the syntax.

  <!--The parentheses around click tell Angular to listen for the <li> element's click event. When the user clicks in the <li>, Angular executes the onSelect(hero) expression.-->
  <li *ngFor="let hero of heroes">
    <!--The Angular class binding makes it easy to add and remove a CSS class conditionally. Just add [class.some-css-class]="some-condition" to the element you want to style.-->
