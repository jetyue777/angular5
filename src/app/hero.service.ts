 You must provide the HeroService in the dependency injection system before Angular can inject it into the HeroesComponent, as you will do below.

 */

/*
 In real app, The HeroService must wait for the server to respond, getHeroes() cannot return immediately with hero data, and the browser will not block while the service waits.

 HeroService.getHeroes() must have an asynchronous signature of some kind.

 It can take a callback. It could return a Promise. It could return an Observable.

 In this tutorial, HeroService.getHeroes() will return an Observable in part because it will eventually use the Angular HttpClient.get method to fetch the heroes and HttpClient.get() returns an Observable.

 Observable is one of the key classes in the RxJS library.
