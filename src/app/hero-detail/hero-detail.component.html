          [(ngModel)] is Angular's two-way data binding syntax.

          Here it binds the hero.name property to the HTML textbox so that data can flow in both directions: from the hero.name property to the textbox, and from the textbox back to the hero.name.

          Although ngModel is a valid Angular directive, it isn't available by default.

          It belongs to the optional FormsModule and you must opt-in to using it.

      <button (click)="goBack()">go back</button>
